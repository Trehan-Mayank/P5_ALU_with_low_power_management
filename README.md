# ALU-with-Power-Management-Unit-PMU-
This project implements a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) integrated with a Power Management Unit (PMU) for power-aware digital design. The PMU dynamically controls the ALU’s power domain using isolation and power switch control signals, mimicking how real SoCs save power when blocks go idle.
